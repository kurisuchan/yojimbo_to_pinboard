#Yojimbo to Pinboard

This is an Applescript and Python combo to export your bookmarks from [Yojimbo][1] to [Pinboard][2]. 

All you should have to do is open export_yojimbo_bookmarks.scpt, fill in your username and password at the top, and hit run.

This was all made possible by [python-pinboard][3].

I make no guarantee that running this will not destroy your data, set your house on fire, or create a black hole that engulfs the planet. Use at your own risk.
